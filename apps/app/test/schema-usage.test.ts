/**
 * Every SQL string in the server is checked against the real schema.
 *
 * TypeScript cannot see inside a template literal, so a column that was renamed
 * in a migration — or invented by a hand that never read one — typechecks
 * perfectly and fails at runtime, in production, on a path that may only run
 * once a day. Four separate column mismatches were already found by hand while
 * this app was being written; this test is what makes the fifth impossible.
 *
 * The approach is deliberately blunt: apply the migration to an in-memory
 * database, then ask SQLite to `EXPLAIN` every statement we ship. SQLite's own
 * parser is the only authority that cannot disagree with SQLite.

 * fails to parse for a reason that has nothing to do with the schema.
 *
 * Quoted strings are collected too, and it took a live failure to learn why:
 * a one-line `'SELECT id FROM segments WHERE workspace_id = ? AND live = 1'`
 * selected a column that has never existed in any migration. It was invisible
 * to this test because it needed no interpolation and so was never written in
 * backticks, and it threw `no such column: live` on every hourly cron tick in
 * production instead. Comments are skipped, or an apostrophe in prose opens a
 * string literal that runs to the next one.
