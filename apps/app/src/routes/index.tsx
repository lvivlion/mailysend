/**
 * The hero leads with the `resend` client, not with ours.

 * The README's first code block is a three-line diff against an existing

 * the official client resolves its base URL as
 * `process.env.RESEND_BASE_URL || 'https://api.resend.com'` (verified in
 * resend@6.27.0), so adopting MailySend is an environment variable rather than
 * a rewrite. Opening with `import { MailySend } from 'mailysend'` asked the

 * that actually distinguishes the product. The first-party SDK keeps the tab

        The AFTER block deliberately keeps `import { Resend } from 'resend'`. The
        official client resolves its base URL as
        `process.env.RESEND_BASE_URL || 'https://api.resend.com'` (verified in
        resend@6.27.0), so the migration is an environment variable and not an
        edit — which is a strictly stronger claim than swapping the import for
        `mailysend/compat`, and the one the README leads with. The shim and the
        first-party SDK stay in the prose: they are the explicit alternative, not
        the cheapest path. If this ever shows a changed import again, check that
        `resend` still reads that variable first.
