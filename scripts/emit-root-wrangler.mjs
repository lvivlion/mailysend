/**
 * Writes a repo-root `wrangler.json` after a Cloudflare build.
 *
 * Cloudflare Workers Builds and the Deploy to Cloudflare button both run their
 * deploy command from the repository root, and both default it to a bare
 * `npx wrangler deploy`. In a pnpm workspace with no config at the root that
 * fails before it does anything:
 *
 *   The Cloudflare application detection logic has been run in the root of a
 *   workspace instead of targeting a specific project.
 *
 * Requiring every operator to edit the deploy command in the dashboard defeats
 * the entire one-click story, so the build leaves a config where the default
 * command already looks. It is a copy of the config Vite generates next to the
 * bundle, with the two path fields rewritten to be root-relative — no second
 * source of truth for bindings, because it is regenerated from the first one on
 * every build. It is build output, and gitignored as such.
