/**
 * Scopes account-global resource names to the Worker that owns them.
 *
 * Queue names, D1 database names and R2 bucket names are account-global, and a
 * queue has exactly one consumer. So a second MailySend on one Cloudflare
 * account uploaded fine and then failed its trigger update, once per queue:
 *
 *   Queue 'ms-send' (UUID 'a82e…') already has a consumer. [code: 11004]
 *
 * — and where it did not fail, it was worse: the new instance bound `DB` and
 * `BUCKET` to the first instance's database and bucket and started reading
 * somebody else's mail. Neither is a thing the operator asked for by naming
 * their Worker something else.
 *
 * The rule is one line: every name that has to be unique on the account is
 * derived from the Worker's name. `mailysend16` gets `mailysend16-send`,
 * `mailysend16-inbound`, a `mailysend16` database and a `mailysend16` bucket.
 *
 * The default deployment is left exactly as it is. A deployment named
 * `mailysend` keeps `ms-send` and the `mailysend` database it already has,
 * because renaming those for an instance that is already running would point it
 * at an empty database, which is not a rename but a data loss with a changelog
 * entry. This only ever names resources for a Worker that does not have any.
 *
 * KV is here too, as a title rather than a rename: a namespace is addressed by
 * id, so the scoping is in what a new one is *called* and which existing one a
 * build is allowed to adopt.

 * Whether this build may give the instance its *own* database and bucket.
 *
 * Getting this wrong in the unsafe direction cost a live deployment its data
 * for eight minutes: scoping on the name alone pointed a running `mailysend14`
 * at a `mailysend14` database that did not exist, the app created it, ran every
 * migration, and came up as a fresh unclaimed instance with the real one —
 * users, domains, mail — still sitting in `mailysend`. Nothing was lost, and
 * nothing about that was obvious from the build log either.
 *
 * So a rename is only ever applied to an instance that cannot yet have data:
 *
 *   - a database already named after the Worker — it was scoped before, and
 *     that is its database
 *   - otherwise a Worker that has never been deployed to this account — a new
 *     instance, which is the case the scoping exists for
 *   - otherwise nothing: a Worker that is already running keeps what it is
 *     running on, because the alternative is stranding it

 * `deployed` and `hasOwnDatabase` are answers from the account, which is why
