/**
 * Creates the account resources `wrangler deploy` refuses to deploy without.
 *
 * The Deploy to Cloudflare button provisions less than the docs imply, and
 * wrangler validates every binding before it uploads, so a clean account used
 * to fail one resource at a time — first `Queue "ms-events-cf" does not exist`,
 * then `KV namespace 'PLACEHOLDER' is not valid`. Each failure came after a
 * 4.5 MB upload and told the operator to go and run something by hand, which is
 * not a one-click deploy.
 *
 * The only hook the inferred Workers Builds flow gives us is the build command,
 * so this runs at the end of `build:cf`:
 *
 *   - queues   created by name; twelve of them, including the dead-letter queue
 *   - R2       created by name
 *   - D1 + KV  created if absent, then their ids written into the generated
 *              wrangler config, because those ids cannot be known in advance
 *
 * Everything is matched by name first and created only when missing, so the
 * second and every later build is a no-op. That matters more than it sounds:
 * re-creating the SUPPRESSIONS namespace instead of reusing it would silently
 * empty the one list that must never be lost.
 *
 * It runs only inside Workers Builds (`WORKERS_CI=1`) or when you set
 * `MS_ENSURE_RESOURCES=1`. A local `pnpm run build:cf` must never create things
 * in somebody's account as a side effect of building.
 *
 * If the build token cannot create a resource, this does not fail the build.
 * The ids are simply left out, which is exactly the shape wrangler's own
 * automatic provisioning expects — so the deploy still gets a chance to create
 * them itself, and only then fails with wrangler's own message.
