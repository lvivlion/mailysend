/**
 * One actor per (workspace, sending domain).
 *
 * It owns three things that must be serialised somewhere, and a domain is the
 * natural boundary for all three:
 *
 *   - the send-rate governor, so a broadcast cannot outrun the provider,
 *   - the *learned* daily ceiling, and
 *   - the per-provider circuit breaker.
 *
 * The learned ceiling is the interesting one. Cloudflare Email Service ramps a
 * domain's daily quota with its reputation and does not publish the number. The
 * only honest way to know it is to observe where sends start failing — so we
 * halve on a quota rejection and creep back up on a clean day. A broadcast
 * consults this before releasing tokens, which turns "first big send generates
 * ten thousand errors and a reputation hit" into "first big send throttles
 * itself into the ramp".
